As part of the Financial Declaration process, you will need to confirm that you are willing and able to fund your living expenses at least at the lower amount in the range shown above, for the duration of your course (for courses longer than one year, you should allow for an estimated increase in living expenses of 3% each year).Please note that the University sets its maintenance stipend level for graduate scholarships at the competitive RCUK minimum doctoral stipend rate, which as a guide equates to ¡ê15,609 for the 2021-22 academic year.How are these likely living costs calculated?In order to provide these likely living costs (which are rounded to the nearest ¡ê5), the University and the Oxford SU conducted a living costs survey to complement existing student expenditure data from a variety of sources, including the UK government's Student Income and Expenditure Survey and the National Union of Students (NUS).


  
  
                        FoodThese likely food costs would enable you to eat in your college for each of your three meals each day and occasional dining out but food costs may be lower or higher, depending on your personal choice about where and what you eat.AccommodationThese likely accommodation costs include related bills (for example, utilities such as electricity and heating) and are based on the latest available college accommodation figures, with an inflationary increase applied. Private sector rental costs may vary. You can find more information about renting in the private sector through the Oxford Student Pad and University Accommodation Office.Study costsThese are likely costs directly related to your studies, such as text books, stationery, printing and photocopying, course-related equipment and materials.OtherThese are small, miscellaneous costs which do not fall under the other categories above.
        
BudgetingFurther advice on planning a budget is available on our Managing your finances page.What additional costs might I need to budget for?You may need to make additional provision for costs such as a student visa, travel to and from Oxford and fieldwork. Any additional course-related costs will be outlined in the individual graduate course pages, accessible via the Courses page. These costs are not included in the figures above.Students with dependants, for example, a partner or child, will also need to consider separate costs related to their family. More information and advice is available in the Living costs for dependants?section of this page.What might my likely living costs be in future years?When planning your finances for any future years of study in Oxford beyond 2022-23, you should allow for an estimated increase in living expenses of 3% each year.?


  
  
                        What advice is there about living costs for part-time students?The living costs above are based on single, full-time students living in Oxford. While it may be the case that, as a part-time student, you will not be based in Oxford during your studies, you will still need to cover your cost of living on a full-time basis. If this applies to you, you should calculate your living costs to be sure that you have sufficient funding to meet these costs for the duration of your course. In particular, part-time students who are not based in Oxford will need to calculate travel and accommodation costs carefully. Please note that living costs outside Oxford may be different from those shown above.
