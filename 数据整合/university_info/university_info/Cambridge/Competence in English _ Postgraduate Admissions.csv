			If you have been set a condition to provide an IELTS or TOEFL test certificate you may be aware that test centres in some countries are closed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the test centre closures, we have made the following changes to our English language requirements. We are now accepting a number of alternative tests, so please visit our coronavirus-related FAQ section for further information.
			
		
	


If English isn’t your first language, you will be required to submit evidence that you meet the University’s English language requirement before you are admitted to your proposed course of study.

Who has to provide a language test certificate?

Whether or not you have to take a language test will depend on a number of conditions, which you may calculate below.

Select the country of your nationality:

   Search for a country...                             

What tests are accepted?

We accept IELTS and TOEFL, this includes respective home testing solutions. Some courses also accept CAE (C1 Advanced), and CPE (C2 Proficiency) and you can check this on the individual course pages. Tests are only accepted if they have been taken in the two years before the start of your proposed course of study. For more information on the tests we accept see the What Tests Are Accepted? page.

What are the minimum scores accepted in the language test?

The minimum score requirement will vary by course. Please check the specific course webpage for your course to find the minimum language scores you are required to meet. It is not possible to combine scores from different language test certificates; you must meet the minimum requirements for all elements in the same sitting.

When to take the language test

There can sometimes be long waiting times for a TOEFL or IELTS Language Test place, so you should make arrangements to take a test as soon as possible, and to allow time for a retest should one be required.

For the majority of courses, if a language test is required, you do not have to provide the results of your language test at the point of application, and you can submit your application for admission without them. However, the Master of Law (LLM), and Master of Corporate Law (MCL) do require you to submit your language test results with your application for admission.

In all cases, if a language test is required, you will be asked to provide the test results if you are made an offer of admission, and you cannot be admitted without a valid accepted language test certificate.

Providing your Language test results

The test report results can be provided via the Applicant Portal before you submit your application. If you are made an offer of admission, and have not provided a test report, and are required to provide one, you will be asked to upload a valid test certificate via the Applicant Self Service to meet the language condition of your offer.

We verify all results using online verification services.

When providing test report results please ensure the following information is included:

IELTS


	Test Report Form (TRF) number
	The scores for each element.
	Date the test was taken

	Registration Number
	Date of birth
